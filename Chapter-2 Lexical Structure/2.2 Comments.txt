2.2 Comments
JavaScript supports two styles of comments. Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript. Any text between the characters /*and */is also treated as a comment; these comments may span multiple lines but may not be nested. The following lines of code are all legal JavaScript comments:
// This is a single-line comment.
/* This is also a comment */ // and here is another comment.
/*
* This is yet another comment.
* It has multiple lines.
*/

2.2 注释
JS支持两种注释法：
// 单行注释
/* 这样也行 */ // 这也是注释
/*
* 有一条注释
* 可以跨多行
*/
