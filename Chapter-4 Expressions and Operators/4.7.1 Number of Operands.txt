4.7.1 Number of Operands

Operators can be categorized based on the number of operands they expect (their arity). Most JavaScript operators, like the * multiplication operator, are binary operators that combine two expressions into a single, more complex expression. That is, they expect two operands. JavaScript also supports a number of unary operators, which convert a single expression into a single, more complex expression. The − operator in the expression −x is a unary operator that performs the operation of negation on the operand x. Finally, JavaScript supports one ternary operator, the conditional operator ?:, which combines three expressions into a single expression.

4.7.1 运算对象个数

运算符可以按运算对象的个数来分类。
大部分js运算符都是二元的，即通过计算两个运算对象得到一个值。
还有一部分一元运算符，计算一个运算对象，得到一个值。比如-x，用于求x的负值。
而三元有一个?:。
