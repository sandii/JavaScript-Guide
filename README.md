English-Chinese translation of "JavaScript Definitive Guide"



This is a long-term English-Chinese translation work on the book "JavaScript Definitive Guide".

Majored in English during my college time, and worded as an English editor in a state media during the first 3 years after my graduation, I finnaly choose to transfor my career into coding.

Naturally, my English level keep going down the hill, as my daily works now concern English much less, and, as my friend Rafa came back to US taking care of his family.

I hope this work will help on both my down-going English level, and more importantly, my understanding of this beautiful coding language.

And, thousands of respects and thanks should be paid to David Flanagan, the author of the book. His excellent work help me so much during my career transition and my daily work now. It is really a long-time-reading-worthy book, that is why I choose this book despite so many Chinese translation editions can be found on the market.

As I mentioned in the first sentence, this work will be a long journey. It will  ocuppy much time off my work. Thus, I want to bring forward my sorry to my family members, especially to my wife, Fiona, who is always so supportive. Although many interruptions of travial matters and chores are expected, I hope this work can be roughly finished in 1 year.

Finnally, this work is only a personal learning practice, mistakes would be found everywhere in my translation. So happy to hear correction, discussion or suggestion from anybody. If anyone says my work helps a little bit, it will be my greatest pleasure.
